## Introduction

### Motivations

> - Machine Creativity (Computational Creativity)
>   - Intersection of:
>       - Artificial Intelligence
>       - Cognitive Psycology
>       - Philosophy
>       - Art
>   - Goal is to Model, Simulate or Replicate Creativity using a Computer to achieve:
>       - Human-level Creativity
>       - Better understand Human Creativity
>       - Build Tools to Enhance Human Creativity
>   - Creativity Definition (Computational)
>       - Top-Down approach (Explicit Formulation + Randomness):
>           - The answer is novel and useful
>           - The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted 
>           - The answer result from intense motivation and persistence 
>           - The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague
>       - Bottom-Up approach (Artificial Neural Nets):
>           - Learn heuristics from huge corpus
>           - Non-linear pattern exctraction
>
> - Deep Learning Breakthroughs
> 
> - Rise of Generative Neural Networks
> 
> - A case for Lineart Colorization

### Problem Statement

> - Black & White Lineart VS Gray Scale
> - Incomplete Information Challenge fo Computer Vision
> - Natural Artisitic Control Back to the User

### Contributions

> - Recipe for curating datasets for the task of automatic colorization
> - 3 Models exploring different aspect of the topic:
>     - PaintsTorch: High Quality, User-Guided, Fast Realtime Feedback
>     - StencilTorch: Human-Machine Collaboration, Human-in-the-Loop
>     - StableTorch: Variance and Iterative Exploration
> - A reflexion on Current Generative AI Ethical and Societal Impact in our Society

### Concerns

> - Raise awareness about
>   - Deepfakes
>   - Model Fabulations
>   - Ownership & Copyright Ambiguities
>   - Biases & Discrimination
> - About this work
>   - Images used only for Educational and Research Purposes
>   - Only describe recipes for reproducibility
>   - Dataset and Weights are not Distributed (Only Code)
