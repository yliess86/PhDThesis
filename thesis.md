## Introduction

Humans possess the ability to perceive and understand the world allowing us to accomplish a wide range of complex tasks through the combination of visual recognition, scene understanding, and communication. The ability to quickly and accurately extract information from a single image is a testament to the complexity and sophistication of the human brain and is often taken for granted. One of the +ai field's ultimate goals is to empower computers with such human-like abilities, one of them being creativity, being able to produce something original and worthwhile [@mumford_2012]. 

Computational creativity is the field at the intersection of +ai, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and art, which aims at understanding, simulating, replicating, or in some cases enhancing human creativity. One definition of computational creativity [@newell_1959] is the ability to produce something that is novel and useful, demands that we reject common beliefs, results from intense motivation and persistence, or comes from clarifying a vague problem. Top-down approaches to this definition use a mix of explicit formulations of recipes and randomness such as procedural generation. On the opposite, bottom-up approaches use [+ann]{.plural} to learn patterns and heuristics from large datasets to enable non-linear generation.

We, as a species, are currently witnessing the beginning of a new era where the gap between machines and humans is starting to blur. Current breakthroughs in the field of +ai, more specifically in +dl, are giving computers the ability to perceive and understand our world, but also to interact with our environment using natural interactions such as speech and natural language. [+ann]{.plural}, once mocked by the +ai community [@lecun_2019], are now trainable using +gd [@rumelhart_1986] thanks to the massive availability of data and the processing power of modern hardware accelerators such as [+gpu]{.plural}, [+tpu]{.plural}, and [+npu]{.plural}.

[+nn]{.plural}, those trainable general function approximators, gave rise to the field of generative [+nn]{.plurals}. Specialized +dl architectures such as [+vae]{.plural} [@kingma_2013], [+gan]{.plural} [@goodfellow_2014], [+ddm]{.plural} [@ho_2020], and [+llm]{.plural} [@vaswani_2017; @brown_2020] are used to generate artifacts such as text, audio, images, and videos of unprecedented quality and complexity.

This thesis aims at exploring how one could train and use generative +nn to create +ai-powered tools capable of enhancing human creative expression.
