## Introduction

Humans possess the ability to perceive and understand the world allowing us to accomplish a wide range of complex tasks through the combination of visual recognition, scene understanding, and communication. The ability to quickly and accurately extract information from a single image is a testament to the complexity and sophistication of the human brain and is often taken for granted. One of the +ai field's ultimate goals is to empower computers with such human-like abilities, one of them being creativity, being able to produce something original and worthwhile. 

Computational creativity is the field at the intersection of +ai, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and art, which aims at understanding, simulating, replicating, or in some cases enhancing human creativity. One definition of computational creativity is the ability to produce something that is novel and useful, demands that we reject common beliefs, results from intense motivation and persistence, or comes from clarifying a vague problem. Top-down approaches to this definition use a mix of explicit formulations of recipes and randomness such as procedural generation. On the opposite, bottom-up approaches use [+ann]{.plural} to learn patterns and heuristics from large datasets to enable non-linear generation.
